# Computational-Chemistry.

## Research Internship
This rep is focused on devoloping a graph neural netweork(GNN) for drug discovery. The problem statement is as follows:

Using AI for drug discovery has been on the rise since the introdutcion of deep learning and other machine learning intensive approaches to tackle basic problems
in science. One of these such problems is finding appropriate drugs to target a particual or set of cells to eradicate diseases ranging from Cancer to Alzeihmers
. However, testing more than a million compounds to a million targets is extremely expensive and is out of the scope of a practical based approach. This is why 
protein folding has become one of the most imporant recently developed solutions. By predicting the 3D shape of proteins and its spatial geometry, only specific
molecules can attach to a particular receptor. Now with this approach of selecting only those molecules that can attach to the target receptor, we can develop 
a deep learning algorithm that maximises the probabilty of choosing a molecule that has the most desired effect on the target receptor. However, this is not as 
easy as it sounds. The problem is with the scarcity of data. There are extremely few datasets where our model can learn from. Hence we try to use transfer learning,
an approach to learn as much as possible from another data set and use it on a small data set. This repository aims to create a such a model.
